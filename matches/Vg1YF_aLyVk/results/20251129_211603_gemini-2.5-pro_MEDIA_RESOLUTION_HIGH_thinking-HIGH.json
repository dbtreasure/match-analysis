  "prompt": "You are analyzing a BJJ (Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu) competition match video. You have been provided:\n1. The match video\n2. The official IBJJF Rules Book PDF\n\nYour task is to identify and record every scoring change (points, advantages, or penalties) throughout the match.\n\n## Athlete Identification (use this throughout the match)\n\n**Athlete 1 (LEFT side of scoreboard):**\n- Name: ANDY TOMAS MURASAKI PEREIRA\n- Gi color: white\n- Appearance: Muscular build with short, light brown hair in a buzzcut style.\n\n**Athlete 2 (RIGHT side of scoreboard):**\n- Name: TAINAN DALPRA COSTA\n- Gi color: blue\n- Appearance: Athletic build with short dark hair.\n\n**How to tell them apart:** The athletes are wearing different colored gis: one white and one blue.\n\n## How to Identify Scoring Events\n\n1. **Watch the referee** - The referee signals scoring with hand gestures and the scoreboard updates shortly after.\n\n2. **Monitor the scoreboard overlay** - It shows current points, advantages, and penalties for each athlete.\n\n3. **Reference the IBJJF rulebook** for correct point values.\n\n## Scoring Reference (IBJJF Rules)\n\n**Point Values:**\n- 2 points: Takedown, Sweep, Knee on belly\n- 3 points: Guard pass\n- 4 points: Mount, Back control (back mount with hooks)\n\n**Common Scoring Sequences:**\n\nWhen positions flow continuously, points accumulate. Watch for these patterns:\n\n1. **Guard Pass → Mount (7 points total)**\n   - Athlete passes guard: +3 points (score becomes X-3 or 3-X)\n   - Same athlete achieves mount 2-5 seconds later: +4 points (score becomes X-7 or 7-X)\n   - These are TWO separate events to record\n\n2. **Takedown → Guard Pass → Mount (9 points total)**\n   - Takedown: +2, then Pass: +3, then Mount: +4\n   - Three separate events\n\n3. **Sweep → Guard Pass (5 points total)**\n   - Sweep from guard: +2 points\n   - Same athlete passes guard: +3 points\n\n**Advantages (1 at a time):**\n- Near-completion of any scoring position (almost passed guard, almost swept, etc.)\n- Near-submission attempts\n\n**Key Rule:** Each scoring position is a SEPARATE event. A guard pass at 2:00 and mount at 2:03 should be recorded as two events, not one \"7 point\" event.\n\n## For each scoring event, record:\n- timestamp_seconds: Exact time in the video (seconds from start)\n- match_clock: Time shown on the match clock (e.g., \"8:45\")\n- athlete: 1 or 2 (who scored or received penalty)\n- points_change: Points gained/lost (use 0 if only advantage/penalty)\n- advantages_change: Advantages gained/lost (use 0 if only points/penalty)\n- penalties_change: Penalties received (use 0 if only points/advantage)\n- action: Brief description (e.g., \"Takedown\", \"Sweep\", \"Guard pass\", \"Mount\")\n- ibjjf_rule: Rule reference from the rulebook (e.g., \"Art. 4.1 - Takedown\")\n- running_score: Current score as \"athlete1-athlete2\"\n- running_advantages: Current advantages as \"athlete1-athlete2\"\n- running_penalties: Current penalties as \"athlete1-athlete2\"\n\nRecord events when the referee signals or the scoreboard updates, not when the action begins.",
