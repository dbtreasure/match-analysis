  "prompt": "You are analyzing a BJJ (Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu) competition match video. You have been provided:\n1. The match video\n2. The official IBJJF Rules Book PDF\n\nYour task is to identify and record every scoring change (points, advantages, or penalties) throughout the match.\n\n## Athlete Identification (use this throughout the match)\n\n**Athlete 1 (LEFT side of scoreboard):**\n- Name: ROBERTO FRANCISCO JIMENEZ\n- Gi color: blue\n- Appearance: Male athlete with curly brown hair and a beard, wearing a blue gi.\n\n**Athlete 2 (RIGHT side of scoreboard):**\n- Name: ADAM PIOTR WARDZINSKI\n- Gi color: white\n- Appearance: Male athlete with long blonde hair and a beard, wearing a white gi.\n\n**How to tell them apart:** gi color\n\n## How to Identify Scoring Events\n\n1. **Watch the referee** - The referee signals scoring with hand gestures and the scoreboard updates shortly after.\n\n2. **Monitor the scoreboard overlay** - It shows current points, advantages, and penalties for each athlete.\n\n3. **Reference the IBJJF rulebook** for correct point values.\n\n## Point Values (IBJJF Rules)\n\nPoints are ONLY awarded in these amounts:\n- **2 points**: Takedown, Sweep\n- **3 points**: Guard Pass\n- **4 points**: Mount, Back Mount (back control with hooks)\n\nAdvantages are awarded 1 at a time for near-scoring attempts.\nPenalties are given for stalling or rule violations.\n\n## Common Event Patterns\n\n**Guard Pass → Mount sequence**: When an athlete passes the guard (3 pts), they often immediately move to mount (4 pts) within 3-5 seconds. Watch for TWO separate score changes in quick succession.\n\n**Sweep → Pass sequence**: After a sweep (2 pts), the sweeping athlete may quickly pass guard (3 pts).\n\n## For each scoring event, record:\n- timestamp_seconds: Exact time in the video (seconds from start)\n- match_clock: Time shown on the match clock (e.g., \"8:45\")\n- athlete: 1 or 2 (who scored or received penalty)\n- points_change: Points gained/lost (use 0 if only advantage/penalty)\n- advantages_change: Advantages gained/lost (use 0 if only points/penalty)\n- penalties_change: Penalties received (use 0 if only points/advantage)\n- action: Brief description (e.g., \"Takedown\", \"Sweep\", \"Guard pass\", \"Mount\")\n- ibjjf_rule: Rule reference from the rulebook (e.g., \"Art. 4.1 - Takedown\")\n- running_score: Current score as \"athlete1-athlete2\"\n- running_advantages: Current advantages as \"athlete1-athlete2\"\n- running_penalties: Current penalties as \"athlete1-athlete2\"\n\nRecord events when the referee signals or the scoreboard updates, not when the action begins.",
