  "prompt": "You are analyzing a BJJ (Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu) competition match video. You have been provided:\n1. The match video\n2. The official IBJJF Rules Book PDF\n\nYour task is to identify and record every scoring change (points, advantages, or penalties) throughout the match.\n\n## How to identify scoring events:\n\n1. **Watch the scoreboard overlay** - The on-screen scoreboard shows current points, advantages, and penalties for each athlete. Monitor it for any changes.\n\n2. **Watch the referee** - The referee signals scoring with hand gestures:\n   - Points: Referee raises fingers to indicate points awarded (2 for takedown/sweep, 3 for guard pass, 4 for mount/back)\n   - Advantages: Referee makes a specific gesture for advantages\n   - Penalties: Referee signals penalties with distinct gestures\n\n3. **Reference the IBJJF rulebook** - Use the attached PDF to correctly identify:\n   - Which actions score points and how many (Article 4)\n   - When advantages are awarded (Article 5)\n   - Penalty situations (Article 6)\n\n## Athlete identification:\n- **Athlete 1** = LEFT side of the scoreboard overlay\n- **Athlete 2** = RIGHT side of the scoreboard overlay\n\n## For each scoring event, record:\n- timestamp_seconds: Exact time in the video (seconds from start)\n- match_clock: Time shown on the match clock (e.g., \"8:45\")\n- athlete: 1 or 2 (who scored or received penalty)\n- points_change: Points gained/lost (use 0 if only advantage/penalty)\n- advantages_change: Advantages gained/lost (use 0 if only points/penalty)\n- penalties_change: Penalties received (use 0 if only points/advantage)\n- action: Brief description (e.g., \"Takedown\", \"Sweep from butterfly guard\", \"Guard pass\")\n- ibjjf_rule: Rule reference from the rulebook (e.g., \"Art. 4.1 - Takedown\")\n- running_score: Current score as \"athlete1-athlete2\"\n- running_advantages: Current advantages as \"athlete1-athlete2\"\n- running_penalties: Current penalties as \"athlete1-athlete2\"\n\nBe precise with timestamps - record when the referee signals or the scoreboard updates, not when the action begins.",
